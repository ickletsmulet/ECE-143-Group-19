NBA Player Stats and Betting Odds

In this project, we scraped data from the web to use to train our model in predicting NBA
teams' win rates, as well as the optimal betting decisions based on actual betting odds
provided by betting sites in combination with our predictions.


To run the code, you must have several modules installed:
torchvision,
BeautifulSoup,
selenium,
requests


Depending on how you decide to download and save the csv data files,
the code may not find the necessary data files in the desginated paths.
In that case, change the code or the file locations to make the code work.


Some of the code's formatting may be messed up when viewed from GitHub. The code will
still work but it is best viewed in JupyerNotebook for cleaner formatting appearances.
